Linked People Bioscience Project Roadmap
===

This roadmap represents the current core development directions and status of the project.

> The biggest single contribution users can help make to the project is by working on issues, bugs and features that **are not necesarily related to this roadmap**. That is because you have a unique understanding of what is lacking in the project, that would be great to hear. <!---[See CONTRIBUTING.md for more information here](CONTRIBUTING.md)--->

### 2017 Goals:

1. Launch of linked people biosciences
2. Finalization of [Biosciences Ontology](ontology.rdf)
3. Publication of initial paper on University Knowledge Graphs
4. Analysis of Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) to assess impact 

The above goals may well change, but are currently regarded as the primary development priorities for 2017, with the hope to be able to complete all of the above before the end of 2017. This may or may not turn out to be overly ambitious.

## 1. Launch of linked people biosciences

Tracking at https://github.com/jasonclark/linked-people-bioscience/issues.

The release is currently pending the following:

- [ ] Publication of people profiles as RDFa and JSON-LD
- [ ] Population of Graph Data into datastore
- [ ] Visualization of Research Networks using D3.js
- [ ] Search and browse interface for people profiles and recommendations  
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] General stability and feedback

> Beta feedback, and discussions around the above points are very welcome.

## 2. Finalization of [Biosciences Ontology](ontology.rdf)

Tracking at https://github.com/jasonclark/linked-people-bioscience/issues.

The goal is to provide both a comprehensive vocabulary for roles, document types, actions, and relationships to describe Biosciences activity. The rough structure is in place at the moment, but there is a lot still to fill in.

> Extensions in the meantime to the existing [Biosciences Ontology](ontology.rdf) are very welcome.

## 3. Publication of initial paper on University Knowledge Graphs

Tracking at https://github.com/jasonclark/linked-people-bioscience/issues.

> Venue suggestions and contributions are very welcome pending this PR.

## 4. Analysis of Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) to assess impact

Tracking at https://github.com/jasonclark/linked-people-bioscience/issues.

> Suggestions for markup and metrics related to structured data and its impact on results in commercial seach engines are welcome.
